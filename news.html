      Microsofts head of gaming has said Xbox will strive to meet the
      expectations of fans disappointed by the companys first-party product
      release strategy. On Thursday it was announced that Starfield and Redfall
      had been delayed from this year to the first half of 2023, leaving some
      big holes in Xboxs line-up for the remainder of 2022. Following up on the
      news, Xbox boss Phil Spencer acknowledged that fans are eager for more
      first-party games, while reiterating the importance of giving studios the
      time they need to create quality products.
